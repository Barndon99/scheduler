# Interview Scheduler

This project served as an intro to the React framework. There was a heavy focus on getting use to some of the newer features in React including hooks, and testing using Jest/Cypress. The app itself is simple, allowing users to save, edit, and delete interviews. The app was built out with React, and styled with SASS.
