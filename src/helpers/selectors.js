//We need to start by finding the object in our state.days array who's name matches the provided day. 
//With this information we can now access that specific days appointment array.

//Once we have access to the appointment array for the given day, we'll need to iterate through it, 
//comparing where it's id matches the id of states.appointments and return that value.

//We should also probably do a bit of validation. If there are no appointments on the given day, 
//our days data will be empty. According to our tests, in a case like this, we should return an empty array.
